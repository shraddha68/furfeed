FurFeed is a fun and simple web app that fetches random dog images with dog facts and cat images with cat facts using public APIs. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it's a beginner-friendly project that explores API integration, async JavaScript, and DOM manipulation â€” all wrapped in a cute and colorful UI!
